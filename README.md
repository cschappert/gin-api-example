# Gin API Example

An example project layout for Go applications written with the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework.

I've borrowed heavily from [@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout](https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1) and
[golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
